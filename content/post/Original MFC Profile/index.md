##### I got requests to leave my profile as it was because some people have grown attached to it. It’s inaccurate now though, both in circumstance and in attitude. An update is necessary to maintain the raw honesty that people found so refreshing
##### So, I thought preserving it would be for a good compromise with those who were against the update, and that it would make for some interesting perspective for anyone wanting to get to know me better


At this point the writing is a little embarrassing (mostly because I have learned so much and grown so much as a person), but it is part of my story whether I like it or not.


About me
---
You can just call me Ellie. I’d love to tell you that I’ll be the girl of your dreams, that I’ll fulfill your every fantasy then give you a coy warning that you’ll fall for me if you’re not careful, but that would be a big load of bull. I ain’t here just to please you and take my cut. I want to be up front about it. If you’re horny and looking for porn, you’re in the wrong place, please respect the fact that I need to go at my own pace and move along to one of the many more able-bodied and less shy hotties.

I sincerely do not want to waste anyone’s time or tokens. If you’re lonely and looking for company, vulnerability; maybe even intimacy, however, I might just be your gal. Connection was my superpower, back in the day. For now I am just trying to get comfortable with the site and immerse myself in its community; to see if theres a place for me here. I really don’t know what to expect. Wide appeal is out of the question but I feel theres a chance someone out here might take a liking to me and want to help me out or be my friend.

Is there anyone out there who’d enjoy [inevitably] winning at virtual chess against me? (I am epically bad at chess but trying to get better.) Watching me paint a figurine? I wonder if there will be enough/any interest in chatting with me and getting to know me despite my situation…. Yes I’m a little hesitant to take off my clothes but there’s something bigger.

There are limitations to how/how often I can appear on camera. I’m unlike most of the other models in a pretty significant, totally unsexy way. I was excited to find a girl on here who appears to have the same shower chair as me. My enthusiasm waned when I realized that she likely only got hers to use as a prop in videos of her masturbating, though. I own mine because I need it to be able to bathe regularly. Hot, right?

I have a debilitating neuroimmune/neuromuscular disease that makes doing just about anything difficult for me, including standing for any extended period of time. It’s called myalgic encephalomyelitis if you want to look it up. Anyone can get it. It actually has nothing to do with the stuff I went through in my formative years. Just a cruel coincidence. I’ve been sick like this since I was 21. I look the same but everything else has changed. I deal with near constant fatigue and discomfort and I end up in pain when I don’t take it easy enough. I spend the majority of my time resting in bed (usually in relatively high spirits, all things considered) except for a few light activities spread throughout the day. I also can’t think as clearly as your average person (without an acquired brain injury).

Witty banter may not even be in the cards. Like, the other day I forgot the word for mug. You know, those like, sturdy cup thingies for hot chocolate or like, other hot stuff, whatever that’s called… On especially bad days, the cognitive impairment caused by my illness is so severe that I have trouble with even basic communication. Symptoms fluctuate. There are the odd good days, too; days when I’d be walking around the house, smiling, maybe humming to myself, and any onlooker would swear I was perfectly normal; days I might win a scrabble match or cook a real meal or attempt to use my creativity to make something beautiful. They are few and far between, but those are the days I would most like to share with you.

My profile is a work in progress, because getting photos that might take an able bodied person an afternoon/ single shoot to get takes a ton of planning and waiting out symptoms for me. (Please excuse the hideousness of my formatting… It looked a hell of a lot better in the word doc but the spacing didn’t carry over. At some point I’ll go in and fix it.)

I’ve been getting lonesome being all cooped up in the house and I was hoping to scratch that socializing itch. I recently read an article that inspired me to test the waters here and see what I can get out of it. So, if you were asking yourself “what is this mildly abrasive, overly wordy, 7 at best, prudish disabled girl doing on a site like this?” there you have it.

I miss being out in the world and crossing paths with others. I miss getting all gussied up and feeling pretty. I haven’t decided if Im going to pursue camming any further. It will all depend on how the first weeks go. You deserve to know that, in all honesty, I don’t have much to offer. I want people to know what they’re getting into when they enter a chat room with me, and I don’t really want to talk to a whole bunch of people to whom my only appeal is the novelty of a new face. That would be a waste on both ends. Everything I do I put my whole heart into.

I intend to build lasting relationships with a small number of ‘supporters’ rather than ‘fans’. Wow. You did it. You read to the bottom. You made it through all the filters so far. Seriously, good for you. If, knowing all that, you still want to see more of me, gimme some positive reinforcement! I don’t necessarily mean in a financial way. Reach out to me. Tell me about yourself. Connect with me. I know what its like to want to support someone but not have much concrete to give, and I’m not going to reject anyone who doesn’t tip extra or buy me something, especially since you already made it through that painfully long stream of conscious style ‘about me’. (this is assuming I don’t get an overwhelming flood of messages, but somehow I don’t think that’ll be a problem..) Let’s be friends?

Meaning of Life
---
Well there isn’t really one… but what motivates me to keep going is the prospect of knowledge, experience, challenge and contribution. I had my first major existential crisis when I was I think 15 at the realization that, in the context of the history of the earth, permanence isn’t a thing, and that I was truly and completely insignificant (which apparently was hugely upsetting lol typical teenager). I had wanted to leave something behind; to create something unique and lasting. I wanted to make a new discovery. I was really into evolutionary biology at the time, and it wasn’t long before I started noticing the nature of scientific progression.

It’s not a matter of whether things get discovered or not, it’s a matter of who gets there first. If I did make a discovery I wouldn’t be making a meaningful contribution to the collective knowledge of humankind, I would just be getting credit for a naturally unfolding step that someone else just as easily could have taken. It took me many years to come to terms with the fact that everything and everyone that matters to me doesn’t matter in the grand scheme of things; that anything I thought or felt or could try to do will be irrelevant within two generations, and that, further, anything humankind as a whole does during its existence is barely a blip in the cosmos. It depressed me that the extinction of homo Sapien is inevitable.

Imagine that. A scrawny fifteen year old girl with teary eyes and a mascara-stained pillowcase over the mortality of our species. I was an odd little thing. (I only say ‘was’ because I’ve gotten taller since then.) It was a shame that poor lil ellie was having thoughts that she was neither emotionally nor intellectually equipped to handle yet. Anyway, my days as a nihilist are [sort of] over. It’s easy to lose sight of it now that I’m debilitated by chronic illness and unable to do the thing I find most satisfying in life (school; being challenged and growing), but existing for the sake of existing is mostly enough for me. Kindness may not matter in the grand scheme of things but it matters to me and it matters to the person benefitting directly. And there is so much beauty in the world. The awe-inspiring elegance with which the universe operates is worth sticking around to see. As messy and miserable as it can be, there are too many amazing things to learn to waste this astronomically unlikely opportunity to appreciate them.

Five things I can’t live without

- my emotional support animal

- supportive loved ones
- I may have taken this too literally
- the internet
- my bed

Favourite Books
---
I like nonfiction. My personal library has doubled in size since I became ill. I lack mental stamina to the point where I can’t handle taking courses right now, but I still crave intellectual stimulation as much as ever. It’s part of who I am. Books are a way for me to explore, learn and discover at a pace that works for me and without leaving the house. If it has a table of contents AND an index, I’d probably be interested in taking a look at it.

I like books that are broken up into sections because you don’t have to commit to the whole thing to get something meaningful out of it. A excellent example of this is *Napoleon’s Buttons*, which, by the way, I recommend to anyone interested in both material science and history. I always have a bunch of books on the go and books that I keep on hand to bring out for review. If I had to choose one, it would be Rosenberg’s *Nonviolent Communication*. Get a copy. Read it. it’ll change your life if you let it.

Right now I’m picking away at *The Art of Getting Well* (Spero) and a few different books by ME expert David S Bell. My order of *The Gifts of Imperfection* (Brown) recently came in and a friend got me *Sapiens* (Harari) for Christmas, so those are next. I’m most enthusiastic about books that could help me with my recovery or prepare me for my future. I have enough interesting books that I’d never run out of something good to read, but I’m still always getting more. (I also have some books that I no longer have any intention of reading; books that I bought when I was younger and still interested in shit like MENSA; but that I keep around to soothe my insecurity.

I feel like “You know, I own a copy of Dante’s *Inferno*,” is the best I could do to fit in with a group of summa cum laude Ivy graduates or something should such a situation ever arise.) My collection includes books intended for a much younger audience. *50 Ideas You Really Need to Know: Physics*, and *The Periodic Table: Elements with Style* which I actually only came across because I was in the children’s section shopping for the kids I was nanny to at the time. I like that they have illustrations and are non-threatening. They allow me to get me excited about subjects I’m no longer smart enough to actively pursue.

I just like children’s books in general too. I want a copy of Dr Suess’ *Did I Ever Tell You How Lucky You Are* because it was my favourite of the stories my dad read to me before bed when I was little. I’d keep it by my bed and look at it often. It’s such a charming little book. Having interesting reads there to access whenever I want just gives me the most comforting sense of freedom and power. I realize that this is probably meant for favourite works of like, actual literature, like stories or whatever, but to be perfectly honest I haven’t read a real novel since high school.

Fortunately I was exposed to a fair amount of literature back in the day because I took IB, so I’m still passably well-read. I’m talkin’ a ton of Shakespeare, Sophocles, Chaucer…. that’s all I can think of rn but I swear I do pick up on a lot of references… I was a total mess at the time (who wasn’t in hs) though, [in my case because I was] struggling to keep up with the curriculum despite my undiagnosed untreated ADHD and dyslexia. 

I ended up only actually reading a little over half of the books/plays I was supposed to. Of the ones I managed to get through before dropping out of the programme, *Wuthering Heights*, *Like Water for Chocolate*, *1984*, *Night*, and *The Poisonwood Bible* stood out most to me. Come to think of it I skipped at least a quarter of the chapters of pwb but I liked what I did read enough that I feel it’s still worth mentioning. We went through it pretty thoroughly in class anyway.

I appreciate the value of fiction literature more than I used to now but I still veer towards nonfiction for my reading. (The act of reading itself is draining enough for me without throwing in emotional investment in characters. I have limited energy due to my ME, and have to expend more of it in reading related tasks due to dyslexia. That’s what dyslexia is, from a neurophysiological standpoint. Using different parts of your brain for reading/writing. It’s slower and less efficient but can ultimately work just as well with enough practice. On top of all that, ME causes aphasia because it limits cranial blood flow. Needless to say my reading rate is awwwwffuuuullllllyyyyyy sssslllllooooooowwwwwwww) See my wish list for books you can get me for us to read together! Let’s see if I can keep up with you.

Favourite Movies
---
Alternate universe, dystopian, science-fiction, supernatural-y movies appealed to me. ‘On Time’ comes to mind. HP, ‘Divergent’, ‘Hunger games’; stuff I’d avoid like the plague in book form but ate right up in the theatre.

I don’t watch a lot of movies anymore (and I know I’m going to get laughed at for this) but last month I saw the rest of the *Twilight* saga (I had only ever seen the first one) and really enjoyed it. I used to love romantic comedies (indicator turned from green to indigo as I said that, this girl is B-A-S-I-C).

I prefer tv series nowadays. I’m a fan of a lot of the light-hearted Netflix originals like ‘Santa Clarita Diet’, ‘Nailed it’, ‘Sugar Rush’ and ‘Big Mouth’. I have watched ‘Arrested Development’ through literally dozens of times and I STILL occasionally pick up on jokes I didn’t notice before. Because of my limited energy, it’s best for me to avoid emotionally taxing programs. I get very into things and become attached to characters easily. I looooove ‘Bojack Horseman’ but it gets too real (ironic that it’s a show about a talking horse). I always feel like my soul has been dissected after watching a season of it.

Stuff that’s disquieting to me I tend to steer clear of. My very favourite show might have to be ‘Bob’s Burgers’s’. It’s just so cute and silly. Unfortunately I can’t watch it right now because it was taken off Netflix. Grumble. ‘Archer’ is also kinda fun, ‘Kitten Rescuers’ warms my heart, and I liked ‘Rick and Morty’ though it was always awkward because I knew my sensitive feminist-y self would never fit in with the type of superfans it would attract. A couple days ago I watched ‘Russian Doll’ and I really liked it. ‘F is for Family’ was funny once I managed to get into it, and ‘Brooklin 99’ has a place in my heart.

I was super extra extremely into documentaries and docuseries earlier in life but it’s healthier for me to keep my mind on light-hearted tales and fantasy while I’m trying to heal. I get a big enough dose of real world from my reading. That being said, ‘Earth II’ was MIND BLOWING. I still like nature documentaries I just struggle to cope with the feelings I get when conservation is an issue brought up. As a person debilitated by illness, I eat a lot of prepackaged food and I don’t get a whole lot of chances to make environmentally conscious choices like biking or public transport over driving. I’m responsible for a fair amount of waste and carbon emissions. It wouldn’t be that big a deal if I had other stuff to feel good about, but with my current lifestyle the guilt becomes overpowering.

I’m still a vegetarian (more efficient use of resources), but I use amazon a ton and I am not as diligent about recycling and stuff like that as I was when I had more energy. I know all of those things are pieces of the puzzle and it hurts to be reminded that I could be less of a contributor to the environmental stressors that threaten the truly magnificent, delicate and irreplaceable biodiversity that exists on this planet. You know the psychological phenomenon ‘diffusion of responsibility’? I like, UN-evince that.

I quite like the way my strong sense of duty manifests itself (as initiative, compassion) when I’m in a better mental place but during depressive episodes it just turns into useless, crippling, mind-melting guilt. That drive to take on/intervene is something I’ve had to learn to tame now that my recovery depends on taking it easy. Okay. Tangent over. ‘The Simpsons’ is good. Lisa was my role model growing up, can you tell?

Perfect Mate
---
We met five years ago at an event on campus. He carried himself and spoke with an air of self-assuredness, but his behaviour was positively meek. I remember being surprised because I wouldn’t have expected that from someone who looked like him (….as in that particular brand of attractiveness). He took an immediate and unpretentious interest in my mind; he didn’t just want to learn about me, he wanted to learn from me. I sensed a great deal of respect for me from him. It was the prince charming scenario I had always fantasized about. I was extremely intrigued. to be continued…..

Perfect Date
---
That’s a tough one. I’d have to say April 25, because it’s not too hot, not too cold. But seriously before I was housebound I loved going to cafes for specialty coffee and then just walking around and talking. I liked going to galleries or museums, stores (especially Chapters), paths through the forest/wilderness, and sometimes touristy places. Little adventures like that were my favourite thing. When I went out to dinner with someone I would bring my Set cards or Bananagram tiles and shamelessly start a round while waiting for the food to come. I enjoyed sit-down restaurants because atmosphere is super important for me.

I liked that it’s such a social experience, and because it was nice to have food brought to me by someone who was being fairly compensated and then cleaned up after with minimal waste. It’s actually a little bit difficult for me to imagine outings being a pleasant experience again (I’m sensitive to light and sound, and I tire extremely easily) but I think if I were still able-bodied my perfect date would involve going to the animal shelter to play with the kitties then picking up treats to snack on while we take a long drive. We could explore a new area and see where that takes us. Maybe we browse an Amish furniture shop or stroll through a greenhouse. Then at the end of the day, we head home to enjoy a bottle of wine while chatting with low-calorie tv in the background. God I miss the days when I got to do stuff like that.
